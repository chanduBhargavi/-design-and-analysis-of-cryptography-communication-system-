# -design-and-analysis-of-cryptography-communication-system-
This project focuses on the design and analysis of a secure communication system using cryptographic techniques to protect data during transmission over insecure networks. The system ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of information by applying modern cryptographic algorithms.
